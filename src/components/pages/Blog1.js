      <tr ><td colspan="2"><p>Computers are taking over whether you’re ready for it or not. There is an ongoing debate among scientists and futurists, however, about how much computers can expand in terms of their “thinking” and “feeling” capabilities.
Humans are unique in their cognitive abilities – but what if computers get to a point where they can match us in rational thinking one day? That’s been the question many philosophers have been mulling over the last several decades. We are getting closer to a definitive answer every day.
You might be familiar with the Turing Test, a method of inquiry in AI for figuring out whether or not a computer can think like a human. The test is named for its creator, an English computer scientist, theoretical biologist, and cryptanalyst Alan Turing. There have been a few computers built that can pass the Turing test already.Besides making science fiction a reality, AI has shown promise in a ton of industries. You probably already interact with AI-powered machines on a daily basis and don’t even realize it. Below, we’ll dive into how AI and machine learning are transforming the business scene.

      <tr><td colspan="2"><p>Modern criminals and terrorists hide amongst the patterns of innocent civilians, exactly mirroring daily life until the very last moments before becoming lethal, which can happen as quickly as a car turning onto a sidewalk or a man pulling out a knife on the street. As police intervention of an instantly lethal event is impossible, law enforcement has turned to prediction based on the surveillance of public and private data streams, facilitated by legislation like the Patriot Act, USA Freedom Act, and the UK's Counter-Terrorism Act. This legislation sparks a heated debate (and rightly so) on the tradeoff between privacy and security. In this blogpost, we explore whether much of this tradeoff between privacy and security is merely a technological limitation, overcommable by a combination of Homomorphic Encryption and Deep Learning. We supplement this discussion with a tutorial for a working prototype implementation and further analysis on where technological investments could be made to mature this technology. I am optimistic that it is possible to re-imagine the tools of crime prediction such that, relative to where we find ourselves today, citizen privacy is increased, surveillance is more effective, and the potential for mis-use is mitigated via modern techniques for Encrypted Artificial Intelligence.</p></td></tr>

      <tr><td colspan="2"><p >While AI assistants such as Siri and Google Home help us maintain our day-to-day groceries list and change our shopping experience, an ideal situation would be to walk into a smart store without any shop attendees or long check-out queues.
Imagine a shopping experience where you can just enter a shop, pick up the stuff you want, a bunch of facial recognition algorithms process your purchase, and automatically money gets deducted from your digital wallet when you leave the store! Suddenly, shopping seems to become more of technology experience.
Amazon has been marginally successful in replicating this experience for customers with its Amazon Go grocery store. In order for shoppers to use this, they need to install the Amazon Go app. There are digital sensors on the shelves that detect when purchases are made and the money gets deducted from the customer’s account when he or she exits the shop.
